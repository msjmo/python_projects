""" The reason for doing "image_grid.permute(1, 2, 0)"

PyTorch modules processing image data expect tensors in the format C × H × W.

Whereas PILLow and Matplotlib expect image arrays in the format H × W × C

So to use them with matplotlib you need to reshape it
to put the channels as the last dimension:

I could have used permute() method as well like below
"np.transpose(npimg, (1, 2, 0))"

------------------

Tensor.detach() is used to detach a tensor from the current computational graph. It returns a new tensor that doesn't require a gradient.

When we don't need a tensor to be traced for the gradient computation, we detach the tensor from the current computational graph.

We also need to detach a tensor when we need to move the tensor from GPU to CPU.
